<h3>The Gangs of Lagos</h3>
<p>
This movie is so relatable as to what is happening in Nigeria, lagos to be precise, it is so real,and it makes a whole lot of sense to me, as far as the Politics is concerned in my country, everyone has to get their hand dirty to be able to be in the position of power
</p>

In this movie, it talks about how the bond between siblings can be so strong, it is action packed, and relatable as well
</p>
